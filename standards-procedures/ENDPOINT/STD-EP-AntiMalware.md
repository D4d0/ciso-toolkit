# Anti-Malware Protection Standard

## Purpose & Scope

**Purpose**: This standard defines the requirements for anti-malware protection on all endpoint devices to prevent, detect, and remove malicious software.

**Scope**: This standard applies to all endpoint devices including workstations, laptops, servers, and mobile devices.

## Applicability

This standard applies to:
- All Windows, macOS, and Linux endpoints
- All mobile devices (iOS, Android)
- All server systems
- All virtual machines
- All cloud-based endpoints

## References

- [POL-11 Endpoint Security Policy](../../policies/POL-11_EndpointSecurityPolicy.md)
- NIS2 Directive (EU) 2022/2555
- Internal endpoint security framework

## Roles & RACI

| Role | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Endpoint Administrator | ✓ | | | |
| CISO | | ✓ | | |
| Security Team | ✓ | | | |
| System Administrators | ✓ | | | |

## Requirements

### Anti-Malware Capabilities
- **Real-time Protection**: Continuous real-time scanning
- **On-Demand Scanning**: Manual and scheduled scanning
- **Email Protection**: Email attachment and link scanning
- **Web Protection**: Web browsing protection
- **USB Protection**: Removable media scanning

### Detection Requirements
- **Virus Detection**: Traditional virus detection
- **Spyware Detection**: Spyware and adware detection
- **Rootkit Detection**: Rootkit and bootkit detection
- **Ransomware Detection**: Ransomware behavior detection
- **Zero-Day Protection**: Unknown threat detection

### Response Capabilities

- **Threat Removal**: Automatic threat removal
- **System Repair**: System file repair capabilities
- **Rollback**: System rollback capabilities
- **Notification**: Alert and notification systems

## Procedures

### Anti-Malware Deployment Process
1. Assess endpoint environment and requirements
2. Select appropriate anti-malware solution
3. Configure anti-malware policies and rules
4. Deploy anti-malware agents to endpoints
5. Test and validate anti-malware functionality

### Threat Response Process
1. Detect and analyze malware threats
2. Assess threat severity and impact
3. Implement appropriate response actions
4. Monitor response effectiveness
5. Document and learn from incidents

## Evidence to Retain

- Anti-malware configuration records: 7 years
- Threat detection logs: 7 years
- Response action logs: 7 years
- Security testing results: 3 years

## Exceptions & Deviations

Exceptions may be granted by the CISO for legacy systems that cannot support anti-malware requirements.
