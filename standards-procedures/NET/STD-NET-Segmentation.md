# Network Segmentation Standard

## Purpose & Scope

**Purpose**: This standard defines the requirements for network segmentation to isolate critical systems and limit the impact of security incidents.

**Scope**: This standard applies to all network infrastructure and systems that require segmentation for security purposes.

## Applicability

This standard applies to:
- All network segments and VLANs
- Critical business systems
- DMZ networks
- Internal network zones
- Cloud network environments

## References

- POL-06 Network Security Policy
- NIS2 Directive (EU) 2022/2555
- Internal network architecture standards

## Roles & RACI

| Role | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Network Administrator | ✓ | | | |
| CISO | | ✓ | | |
| Security Team | ✓ | | | |
| System Administrators | ✓ | | | |

## Requirements

### Segmentation Zones
- **DMZ Zone**: Public-facing systems and services
- **Internal Zone**: Internal business systems
- **Management Zone**: Network management systems
- **Critical Zone**: Critical business systems
- **Guest Zone**: Guest and temporary access

### Access Controls
- Inter-zone communication must be controlled
- Zone access must be logged and monitored
- Default deny rules must be implemented
- Regular access reviews must be conducted
- Zone boundaries must be clearly defined

### Security Controls
- Firewall rules must enforce segmentation
- Network monitoring must cover all zones
- Intrusion detection must be zone-aware
- Traffic analysis must be conducted regularly
- Zone isolation must be tested periodically

## Procedures

### Segmentation Implementation Process
1. Identify systems and data requiring segmentation
2. Design network segmentation architecture
3. Implement segmentation controls
4. Test segmentation effectiveness
5. Monitor and maintain segmentation

### Access Control Process
1. Define inter-zone communication requirements
2. Implement firewall rules for zone access
3. Configure monitoring and logging
4. Test access controls
5. Review and update access rules

## Evidence to Retain

- Network segmentation documentation: 7 years
- Access control logs: 1 year
- Segmentation testing results: 3 years
- Zone access reviews: 3 years

## Exceptions & Deviations

Exceptions may be granted by the CISO for business-critical requirements that cannot be met through standard segmentation.
