# Cryptography and Data Protection Policy

## Purpose & Scope

**Purpose**: This policy establishes the framework for implementing cryptographic controls and data protection measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets.

**Scope**: This policy applies to all data at rest, data in transit, and cryptographic systems used to protect information assets within the organisation.

## Applicability

This policy applies to:
- All data stored on organisational systems
- All data transmitted over networks
- All cryptographic systems and key management
- All personnel handling sensitive data
- All third parties with access to sensitive data

## References

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- NIS2 Directive (EU) 2022/2555
- ISO 27001:2022 Information Security Management Systems
- Data Protection Act 2018
- Cryptographic standards and guidelines

## Roles & RACI

| Role | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Data Protection Officer | ✓ | | | |
| CISO | | ✓ | | |
| Security Team | ✓ | | | |
| System Administrators | ✓ | | | |
| All Personnel | ✓ | | | |

## Requirements

### Data Classification
- All data must be classified according to sensitivity
- Data handling requirements must be defined based on classification
- Data classification must be reviewed regularly
- Data classification must be communicated to all personnel

### Data at Rest Protection
- Sensitive data at rest must be encrypted
- Encryption algorithms must meet approved standards
- Encryption keys must be managed securely
- Data backup must be encrypted

### Data in Transit Protection
- Data in transit must be encrypted
- Secure communication protocols must be used
- Network encryption must be implemented
- Remote access must be encrypted

### Key Management
- Cryptographic keys must be generated securely
- Key distribution must be controlled and documented
- Key storage must be secure and protected
- Key lifecycle must be managed properly

## Procedures

### Data Encryption Process
1. Identify data requiring encryption
2. Select appropriate encryption method
3. Implement encryption controls
4. Test encryption functionality
5. Monitor encryption compliance

### Key Management Process
1. Generate cryptographic keys securely
2. Distribute keys to authorised personnel
3. Store keys securely
4. Monitor key usage
5. Rotate keys regularly

### Data Protection Process
1. Classify data according to sensitivity
2. Implement appropriate protection measures
3. Monitor data access and usage
4. Review protection effectiveness
5. Update protection measures as needed

## Evidence to Retain

At Documentation Level 3, the following evidence must be maintained:
- Data classification records: 7 years
- Encryption implementation logs: 7 years
- Key management records: 7 years
- Data protection audit reports: 7 years
- Cryptographic compliance reports: 7 years

## Exceptions & Deviations

Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the CISO under the following conditions:
- Legacy systems that cannot support encryption
- Business-critical operations with unavoidable risks
- Regulatory requirements that conflict with policy requirements

All exceptions must be documented and reviewed quarterly.

- **Review Scope**: Encryption standards, key management procedures, data protection requirements

## Supporting Standards and Procedures

- **Data at Rest Encryption**: `standards-procedures/DATA-PROT/POL-DATA-AtRestEncryption.md`
- **Data in Transit Encryption**: `standards-procedures/DATA-PROT/POL-DATA-InTransitEncryption.md`
- **Cryptographic Standards**: `standards-procedures/DATA-PROT/STD-CRYPTO-Standards.md`
- **Media Sanitization**: `standards-procedures/DATA-PROT/STD-MEDIA-Sanitization.md`

## Future KPIs (for L4+)
- Data encryption compliance: Target 100%
- Key management compliance: Target 95%
- Data protection incident rate: Target <1% annually
- Cryptographic audit score: Target 95%
