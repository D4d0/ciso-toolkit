# Logging and Monitoring Policy

## Purpose & Scope

**Purpose**: This policy establishes the framework for implementing comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities to detect, respond to, and prevent security incidents and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Scope**: This policy applies to all information systems, networks, and security controls that generate logs or require monitoring for security and compliance purposes.

## Applicability

This policy applies to:
- All information systems and applications
- All network infrastructure and security devices
- All personnel with access to monitoring systems
- All third-party systems and services
- All security monitoring and analysis tools

## References

- NIS2 Directive (EU) 2022/2555
- ISO 27001:2022 Information Security Management Systems
- Internal security monitoring framework
- Incident response procedures

## Roles & RACI

| Role | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Security Analyst | ✓ | | | |
| CISO | | ✓ | | |
| System Administrators | ✓ | | | |
| Incident Response Team | | | ✓ | |
| All Personnel | | | | ✓ |

## Requirements

### Logging Requirements
- All security-relevant events must be logged
- Logs must be generated in standardised formats
- Log data must be protected from unauthorised access
- Log retention periods must be defined and enforced

### Monitoring Requirements
- Security events must be monitored continuously
- Monitoring systems must be configured appropriately
- Security alerts must be generated and responded to
- Monitoring coverage must be comprehensive

### Log Analysis
- Logs must be analysed regularly for security events
- Security incidents must be detected and escalated
- Log analysis must be documented and reported
- Trends and patterns must be identified and acted upon

### Log Management
- Log storage must be secure and scalable
- Log access must be controlled and audited
- Log integrity must be maintained
- Log disposal must be conducted securely

## Procedures

### Log Collection Process
1. Identify systems and events requiring logging
2. Configure logging systems and tools
3. Implement log collection mechanisms
4. Verify log collection and quality
5. Monitor log collection performance

### Security Monitoring Process
1. Configure monitoring systems and alerts
2. Monitor security events and activities
3. Analyse security logs and events
4. Respond to security alerts and incidents
5. Document monitoring activities and findings

### Log Analysis Process
1. Collect and aggregate security logs
2. Analyse logs for security events and patterns
3. Investigate suspicious activities and events
4. Escalate security incidents as appropriate
5. Document analysis results and actions

## Evidence to Retain

At Documentation Level 3, the following evidence must be maintained:
- Security event logs: 7 years
- Monitoring reports: 3 years
- Log analysis reports: 7 years
- Security alert logs: 7 years
- Monitoring configuration records: 7 years

## Exceptions & Deviations

Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the CISO under the following conditions:
- Legacy systems that cannot support standard logging
- Business-critical operations with unavoidable risks
- Technical constraints that cannot be immediately resolved

All exceptions must be documented and reviewed monthly.
