# Backup and Recovery Policy

## Purpose & Scope

**Purpose**: This policy establishes the framework for implementing backup and recovery procedures to ensure business continuity and data protection in the event of system failures or data loss.

**Scope**: This policy applies to all information systems, data, and services that require backup and recovery capabilities to maintain business operations.

## Applicability

This policy applies to:
- All critical information systems and data
- All personnel involved in backup and recovery operations
- All third-party backup and recovery services
- All disaster recovery procedures
- All business continuity processes

## References

- NIS2 Directive (EU) 2022/2555
- ISO 27001:2022 Information Security Management Systems
- Business continuity requirements
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Requirements

### Backup Requirements
- All critical data must be backed up regularly
- Backup frequency must be based on business requirements
- Backup data must be stored securely and separately
- Backup integrity must be verified regularly

### Recovery Requirements
- Recovery time objectives (RTO) must be defined
- Recovery point objectives (RPO) must be defined
- Recovery procedures must be documented and tested
- Recovery capabilities must be verified regularly

### Backup Security
- Backup data must be encrypted
- Backup access must be controlled and monitored
- Backup media must be handled securely
- Backup disposal must be conducted securely

### Testing and Validation
- Recovery procedures must be tested regularly
- Backup integrity must be verified
- Recovery capabilities must be validated
- Test results must be documented and reviewed

## Procedures

### Backup Process
1. Identify data and systems requiring backup
2. Define backup schedules and retention periods
3. Implement backup procedures and tools
4. Execute backup operations according to schedule
5. Verify backup integrity and completeness

### Recovery Process
1. Assess recovery requirements and priorities
2. Select appropriate backup data for recovery
3. Execute recovery procedures
4. Verify system functionality and data integrity
5. Document recovery activities and results

### Testing Process
1. Schedule regular recovery tests
2. Execute recovery test procedures
3. Verify recovery capabilities and performance
4. Document test results and findings
5. Update recovery procedures based on test results

## Evidence to Retain

At Documentation Level 3, the following evidence must be maintained:
- Backup logs and records: 7 years
- Recovery test results: 7 years
- Recovery procedure documentation: 7 years
- Backup integrity verification reports: 3 years
- Recovery performance reports: 3 years

## Exceptions & Deviations

Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the CISO under the following conditions:
- Legacy systems that cannot support standard backup procedures
- Business-critical operations with unavoidable risks
- Technical constraints that cannot be immediately resolved

All exceptions must be documented and reviewed quarterly.
